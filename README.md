Hello, I'm **Owen Moore**,

As a creative developer who is passionate about generative art and parametric design, I am driven to leave my mark on the world within the infinite domain that is born of the entropic collaboration between man and machine. Each line of code acts as my brushstroke, depicting visions of what could be and what cannot. Through iterative imagination, I uncover inspirations that propel me to create works of beauty and emotion.
