Hello, I'm **Owen Moore**,

I’m an artist and creative developer based in Vancouver, Canada, specializing in stochastic algorithms. I’m known for my unique rendering techniques and for incorporating interactivity, soundscapes, and motion into my works. Through OWMO Studio LTD, my art practice focuses on producing works for physical mediums as well as live installations or browser-based experiences. I love the intersection of technology and creativity and actively pursue work in these areas.
