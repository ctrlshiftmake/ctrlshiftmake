Hello, I'm **Owen Moore**,

I'm an artist and creative developer known for incorporating interactivity, soundscapes, and motion into my works. I operate a generative art practice via OWMO Studio LTD in which I use blockchain technology to instantiate pieces and act as an archival medium for my work. I love the intersection of technology and creativity.
